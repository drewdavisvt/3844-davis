                 <p> It started with a hope. Good could come from past people's past mistakes. "They [Scientists] have enabled him [man] to throw masses of people against one another with cruel weapons. They may yet allow him truly to encompass the great record and to grow in the wisdom of race experience." The idea of science for a world database soon turned into a real possibility. "This [The World Encyclopedia] is no remote dream, no fantasy."</p>

                    <p> A major step occured of progress with the UNIVAC computerâ€™s design.  This first electronic computer that greatly simplified many tasks and was a part of an overall trend in sucess. "Computing after 1945 is a story of people who at critical moments redefined the nature of the technology itself. In doing so they opened up computing to new markets, new applications, and a new place in the social order." </p>

                    <p> Yet, more change was needed. Tim Berners-Lee proposed another key idea of storing knowledge. "In providing a system for manipulating this sort of information, the hope would be to allow a pool of information to develop which could grow and evolve with the organization and the projects it describes." </p>

                    <p> Soon the dreams of the so many scientists and the Internet was here. However, as a sad twist of fate  many copyright laws began to limit the knowledge so many wanted to be seen. "Overregulation stifles creativity. It smothers innovation. It gives dinosaurs a veto over the future. It wastes the extraordinary opportunity for a democratic creativity that digital technology enables." </p>

                    <p> As the knowledge gets more tightly restricted, one new program at Virginia Tech, The VT-shaped student model, is being partially hurt. The program looks to see scholars not only have major and minor classes, but community experience and worldly problem solving skills. "We want to prepare students who can tackle the complex global problems and opportunities of the future. To do that, students need to be adaptable, resilient, and culturally competent, seeing the world through the lens of empathy and our university's motto, Ut Prosim..." "The center [in Virginia Tech's Liberal Arts] will lead the expansion and enhancement of opportunities for undergraduate research, study abroad, and career development, including a strong focus on internships and field studies."

                    <p> "We want our students to be able to think from art to science as Galileo did, from science to art as Leonardo did." Vinci was able to do so much for his breathe in topics."[His work] would not have been possible had he not learned both mathematics and anatomy." With copyright laws, his knowledge could have been prevented. How could an English major in the new model learn if not looking at using past books for further advancment?

                    <p> However, the man behind the new model, President Sands, thinks the overall experience will help limit the impact of such laws "The many successes of our alumni provide perhaps the strongest possible testament to the ways in which Virginia Tech's programs across the liberal arts give our students the tools to understand the human component to any equation."
