#Common Moves in Podcasting
For the genre of sports, specifically fighting/entertainment, I picked podcasts on the UFC and WWE. Taekwondo black belt and current UFC commentator Joe Rogan hosts one show and long-time WWE fans Steve and Larson host the other. Though each host(s) have other works, their podcasts tend to have similaries or "common moves" that any podcaster can learn from.

##Steve and Larson's Going In Raw

###WWE ELIMINATION CHAMBER 2017 REVIEW & RESULTS (Going in Raw Pro Wrestling Podcast Ep. 168)
###What's Next For Owens and Jericho? WWE Raw Review & Results 2/13/17 (Going in Raw Ep. 170)

###Organization
The storage of all the podcasts is set-up just as the Joe Rogan Experience. There are navigation links to videos ranging from the newest videos at the top to the oldest at the bottom, playlists of the various projects the duo has, channels they like, among others.

The podcast itself is set-up with the same hosts on every episode. Though guest Dan cubed may sometimes appears, he is not in these two podcasts. Each video of Going In Raw starts the same way. The video starts with a promo sound byte of host Steve. The audio clip reads: > "Be apart of the best pro wrestling podcast today by supporting the Going In Raw patron. You can enjoy the live taping of the show, exclusive merchandise and patron only episode side and so much more. Support Going In Raw today; click the link in the description."
