                    <p> As I began to get a better understanding of coding, Dr. Evia also had the class learn the history of the VT-shaped student as well. From simply students having majors and minors, President Sands wanted more. Instead he wants student, like myself, to gain community experience and worldly problem solving skills.  Though I had already gained community experience, it was not until this class that I gained a new mindset towards problem solving.</p>

                    <p> I was hesitant to take the class, but I have re-learned how lucky I am to have the Internet. How many peopleâ€™s hard work went into and how much goes into one simple page I view on a daily basis. I also re-learned how lucky I am to be a Hokie, where I will get not only a major and minor but also obtain experience and problem solving skills. </p>

                    <p>I wanted to quit this class simply because it was not what I expected. I wanted to quit because it was hard. I decided to try it out and give it my all with an open mind. The same mindset is needed for solving bigger and more complex problems too. By hearing things out with an open mind and seeing what you can do can go a long way. </p>
