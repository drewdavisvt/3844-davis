                    <p>Entering this class, I was not sure what to think about Writing and Digital Media. I knew friends that had English 3844 the previous semester, and they said the class was easy. They described a few video projects and lectures--nothing too hard.  I decided and took the class, but the class was nothing like they had described.</p>

                    <p> Instead of Professor Gardner, whom my friends had, I was introduced to Dr. Evia. Instead of video projects, I would be learning HTML and CSS coding. I was nervous and I wanted to drop out. Yet I, instead, decided I would toughen up and try my best in the class.</p>

                    <p> Starting with readings, I learned about past scholars, such as H.G. Wells, who called for a worldwide network of information. A database must be easily reachable, so past studies could be looked at and built upon.  Later workers began seeing clearer paths to the Internet today. Tim Berners-Lee's Information Management then proposed a common code for information to be for users. What would become the World Wide Web was soon created. For me, it is simply amazing how far we are now with coding and technology. How would Wells, Berners-Lee, and all other scholars who wanted a World Encyclopedia feel if they saw it today? What would they say and would they be happy with what the Internet has become?</p>

                    <p> From the history of wanting and getting transferable code, I began writing it.  The process was slow at first but easer than I thought. Really coding was just like learning anything for the first time. By Dr. Evia keeping things simple, I was able to begin understanding coding in HTML and CSS. Overall, everything was simple with an open mind. The only issue came with getting better with using GitHub. Having my website not open at first, as well as really learning the complex storage, took even more understanding. However, like with learning math, it got easier after passing the initial hurdle. It was interesting seeing all the work that goes into the Internet I take for granted every day. </p>
