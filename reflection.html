                    <p>Entering this class, I was not sure what to think about Writing and Digital Media. I knew friends that had English 3844 the previous semester, and they said the class was managable. They described a few video projects and lectures--it did not seem hard to myself.  I decided and took the class, but the class was nothing like they had described.</p>

                    <p> Instead of Professor Gardner, whom my friends had, I was introduced to Dr. Evia. Instead of video projects, I would be starting with HTML and CSS coding. I was nervous, and I wanted to drop the class. I feared  I would fail at coding. Yet I instead I decided I would toughen up and try my best in the class.</p>

                    <p> Starting with readings, I learned about past scholars, such as H.G. Wells, who called for a worldwide network of information. A database must be easily reachable, so past studies could be looked at and built upon.</p>

                    <p>Later, workers began seeing clearer paths to the Internet today. Tim Berners-Lee's Information Management then proposed a common code for users. What would become the World Wide Web was eventually created.</p>

                    <p>It is simply amazing how far the Internet has come with coding and technology. How would Wells, Berners-Lee, and all other scholars who wanted a World Encyclopedia feel if they saw it today? What would they say and would they be happy with what the Internet has become?</p>

                    <p> From the history of wanting and getting transferable code, I began writing it.  The process was slow at first but easier than I thought. Coding was just like learning anything for the first time. By Dr. Evia keeping things simple, I was able to begin understanding coding in HTML and CSS. Overall, everything was simple with an open mind.</p>

                    <p>The only issue came with getting better with using GitHub. Having my website not open at first, as well as learning the complex storage, took even more understanding. However, it got easier after passing the initial hurdle. It was interesting seeing all the work that goes into the Internet I take for granted. </p>

                    <p> As I began to get a better understanding of coding, Dr. Evia also had the class learn the history of the VT-shaped student as well. From simply students having majors and minors, President Sands wanted more. Instead he wants student, like myself, to gain community experience and worldly problem solving skills.  Though I had already gained community experience, it was not until this class that I gained a new mindset towards problem solving.</p>

                    <p> I was hesitant to take the class, but I have re-learned how lucky I am to have the Internet. How many peopleâ€™s hard work went into and how much goes into one simple page I view on a daily basis. I also re-learned how lucky I am to be a Hokie, where I will get not only a major and minor but also obtain experience and problem solving skills. </p>

                    <p>I wanted to quit this class simply because it was not what I expected. I wanted to quit because it was hard. I decided to try it out and give it my all with an open mind. The same mindset is needed for solving bigger more and complex problems too. By hearing things out with an open mind and seeing what you can do can go a long way. </p>
