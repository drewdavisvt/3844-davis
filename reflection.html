                    <p> For me, I first learned about the VT-shaped in Dr. Evia's Writing and Digital Media class at Vriginia Tech. When the professor first mentioned it, I had no idea what he was talking about nor its importance.</p>

                    <p> I thought about dropping the class. It not only involved coding, but learning in-depth about the new student model sounded hard. Yet, I decided to give the class and model a try.</p>

                    <p> Through out the year, I slowly learned about the model and my place in it. From simply students having majors and minors, President Sands wanted more. Instead he wants student, like myself, to gain community experience and worldly problem solving skills. He also wanted people to simply network and meet more people on campus. Whether it's through fraternities, sororities, or community outreach programs. Though I had already gained community experience, it was not until this class that I gained a new mindset towards problem solving.</p>

                    <p> I slowly learned how lucky I am to be a Hokie, where I will get not only a major and minor but also obtain experience, problem solving skills, and people so many people. </p>

                    <p>I wanted to quit this class simply because it was not what I expected. I wanted to quit because it seemed hard. I decided to try it out and the VT-shaped model and give it my all with an open mind. The same mindset is needed for solving bigger and more complex problems too. By hearing things out with an open mind and seeing what you can do can go a long way. </p>
