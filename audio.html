                    <p>For me, my life has always been surrounded by sports and that all started in Blacksburg. When my sister decided to go to Virginia Tech, from my small hometown of Stuart, Virginia, I was only nine. We soon went to games and I began to love watching football, basketball, and really every sport I could watch there.</p>

                    <p>Wanting to branch lead me to watch new leagues the NFL, NBA, MLS, and FIFA. I had found a love I never knew had and looked to making it just not a job, but a career. Thus, I started working towards being a writer and social media manager. Going back to where it all began, Virginia Tech offered me further education.</p>

                    <p>Since being in Blacksburg I have started my major of Communication and go much real-world experience. I was able to begin writing and posting for sports at The Collegiate Times. Going into the community for sports and learnnig first hand problem solving skills.</p>

                    <p>Under Communication, I was required to take a minor and chose English to further help my writing skills. With English I found my way into Writing and Digital Media.</p>
