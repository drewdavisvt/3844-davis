                    <p>For me, my life has always been surrounded by sports and that all started in Blacksburg. </p>

                    <p> When my sister decided to go to Virginia Tech, from my small hometown of Stuart, Virginia, I was only nine. We soon went to games and I began to love watching football, basketball, and really every sport I could watch there.</p>

                    <p>Wanting to branch out, led me to watch new leagues like the NFL, NBA, MLS, and FIFA. I had found a love I never knew I had and looked to making it just not a job, but a career. Thus, I started working towards being a writer and social media manager. Going back to where it all began, Virginia Tech offered me my further education.</p>

                    <p>Since being in Blacksburg, I have started my major of Communication and got real-world experience. I was able to begin writing and posting for sports at The Collegiate Times (CT). Going into the community, learning how to do interviews, recordings, writing, for sports taught me first-hand knowledge and problem solving skills.</p>

                    <p>Under Communication, I was required to take a minor and chose English to further help my writing skills. With English, I found my way into Writing and Digital Media.</p>

                    <p>Overall I think my interests and Writing and Digital Media overlap a lot. Though this class involves more of the creation of writing templates, at the end of the day it still comes down to writing. English 3844 wants to help a writer's voice best be heard. Any way I can better improve at my skill and my voice helps my passion.</p>

                    <p>In Writing and Digital Media I first learned about the VT-shaped student, the title of my homepage. This student model wants students in Blacksbug to help create classes, have more worldly experience, and problem solving skills. For me this was weird as I already thought Virginia Tech was doing this for me. I mentioned my opportunity and writing for the CT. I have had that experience and learned how to adapt should I have interviews or other reporting problems. Lastly, I am currently in Broadcast Performance for my major. With professor Bill Roth, our class helps pick the projects we work on. Really I am already doing all the elements of the VT-shaped student as I write for it now.</p>
